🧚‍♂️ We cordially invite you to a reading group for the Berlin Tech Workers Coalition (TWC), where those organizing in the tech industry come together to build collective power beyond their individual workplaces.

💫Highlights:

Our reading group meets to discuss topics related to tech. This time we are reading **[Encoding Race, Encoding Class: Indian IT Workers in Berlin](https://www.dukeupress.edu/encoding-race-encoding-class)** by Sareeta Amrute. Contact events@techworkersberlin.com if you need access to the book. Everyone working in the tech industry broadly is warmly welcome. The event will be held in English.


The book is based on ethnographic research, including interviews, political cartoons, advertisements, and reports on white-collar work. Amrute explains how Indian tech workers in Germany are being racialized and treated as temporary and migrant workers despite their aspirations of being middle-class and their efforts to build a new, global, and economically dominant India.

For those who don't have the time to read the whole book, we will recommend chapters to read very soon.
