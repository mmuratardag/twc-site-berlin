For experienced and new works council members alike. We pick one specific topic each month (**Data protection committee** this month) and after a short intro, share best practices and experiences with each other. [Registration mandatory](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIpc-CgrTovGdXTSkrlotQarW0OAuYZLDIf) over Zoom.

Whether you formed a Works Council one week ago or 10 years ago, we want you here! We are here to support each other with advice, questions and collaboration! If there is a topic you are interested in, offer to moderate the following Works Council round-table!

## Data protection committee
* What is it?
* What are the best practices in setting one up, and how can it be leveraged effectively?
