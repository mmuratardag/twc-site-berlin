🧚‍♂️ We cordially invite you to a reading group for the Berlin Tech Workers Coalition (TWC), where those organizing in the tech industry come together to build collective power beyond their individual workplaces.

💫Highlights:

We will read about the [1973 Pierburg strike](https://domid.org/en/news/pierburg-strike-solidarity-among-workers/) led by migrant women, a wildcat strike in Germany and watch a short film afterwards. We're still accepting article/film recommendations if you have any related to this topic/strike!

Everyone broadly working in the tech industry is warmly welcome. The event will be held in English language.
