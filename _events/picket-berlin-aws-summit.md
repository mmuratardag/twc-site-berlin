## Press release

On 15 May at 08:30 am, tech workers are protesting outside the launch of the [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Summit](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/emea/berlin/). We will protest Amazon’s human rights violations and enabling crimes against humanity.

The sold-out AWS Summit is a flagship event organized by Amazon across the globe. Their aim is to highlight their various digital services, cloud-offerings, and latest tech solutions to thousands of current and prospective cloud vendors  and customers. However, they will not want to talk about **Project Nimbus**, a USD$1.2 billion military contract with the Israeli military and government agencies.  

Amazon’s employees, on the other hand, have been vocal against this contract. Over [1,700 workers signed a petition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/02/amazon-israel-gaza-war/), demanding Amazon drop Project Nimbus, given the escalating violence in Gaza in the largest artificial-intelligence assisted conflict to date. The rising death tolls is exacerbated by machine learning driven [artillery-strikes](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/nsa-palantir-israel-gaza-ai/).

We therefore demand that AWS drop **Project Nimbus** immediately.

In the past, we have protested Amazon when they crossed the line with surveilling workers and racially profiling vulnerable [migrant communities](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/22/139639/amazon-is-the-invisible-backbone-behind-ices-immigration-crackdown/). We also must raise our voices now!
