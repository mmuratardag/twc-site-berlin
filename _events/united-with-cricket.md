Calling all cricket fans in Berlin!

Whether you love Rohit Sharma’s pull shots or Shaheen Afridi’s in swinging yorkers, come together as one, united with cricket. Students and workers from South Asia, it’s time to come together again to celebrate your passion for this sport. 

Visit Cafe Karanafil, a historic space for Berlin’s migrant community. 

Bring your friends and make new ones, savour delicious snacks or share the food from your homes, and immerse yourself in the ultimate cricket rivalry. Watch it live as Babar Azam and Jasprit Bumrah pit their unparalleled skills against each other, and Virat Kohli and Haris Rauf recreate unforgettable moments. Celebrate the runs and wickets with the people from Critical Pakistan, Berlin for India, and Cricket Against Fascism. 

The event is supported by the [Lieferando Workers Collective](https://links.couriersunite.de/@lwc), Berlin Tech Workers Coalition, and [ver.di trade union](https://tech.verdi.de/).
