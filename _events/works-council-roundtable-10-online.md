For experienced and new works council members alike. We pick one specific topic each month (**Pay Transparency** this month) and after a short intro, share best practices and experiences with each other. **[Online Registration is mandatory](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwsfu2trT8tG9LIw4uxNWtyq-5bzsEjITAR#/registration)**.

Whether you formed a Works Council one week ago or 10 years ago, we want you here! We are here to support each other with advice, questions and collaboration! If there is a topic you are interested in, offer to moderate the following Works Council round-table!

## Pay Transparency

Come talk with other works councils and individuals to understand what we can do to improve transparency for workers and their pay. **[Register here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwsfu2trT8tG9LIw4uxNWtyq-5bzsEjITAR#/registration)**
