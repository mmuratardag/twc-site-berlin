# Works Councils

We support the formation of Works Councils (Betriebsr√§te) as a means to organize and gain collective power within our workplaces. Below are some basic information on the German system of Works Councils. If you'd like to learn more or have plans to initiate a campaign at your workplace, please get in touch or join us in our next general meeting. Please be aware this is not legal advice.

## Articles

Below we collect articles on Works Council activities in Berlin tech companies. In an interview series, we present perspectives and experiences from Works Councillors. If you are a Works Councillor yourself, or know a fellow worker who is, and would be interested taking part, we'd love to hear from you: [content@techworkersberlin.com](mailto:content@techworkersberlin.com).
